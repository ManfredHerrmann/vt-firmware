SECN 3.0 Duo BB Build Notes
---------------------------

1. By default the Ralink devices will not operate correctly in the BB build.
The kmod-rt28xx-usb drive has a problem which causes the device to appear to work OK but 
actually emits no RF signal.
Removing three patches from the build directory corrects this problem as follows:

  rm package/kernel/mac80211/patches/910-00-rt2x00-enable-rt2800soc-for-mt7620.patch 
  rm package/kernel/mac80211/patches/910-01-add-support-for-mt7620.patch
  rm package/kernel/mac80211/patches/925-rt2x00-backport_rf5362.patch
